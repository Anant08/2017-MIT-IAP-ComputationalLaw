# Overview of Topics and Activities

Check this space after the DataVR Course Module concludes on January 24, 2017 for links to reading and background materials, scheduled speakers, small group exercises and tutorials sessions.  The schedule will feature:

* **Legal Analytics**, including 1) AI/Machine Learning for solving legal use cases; and 2) Using VR for data-driven visualization of complex financial relationships and legal contexts

* **Digital Assets**, including: 1) Ownership rights, valuation and provenance of digital property; and 2) Storage and exchange of digital property with electronic contracts, automated transactions and autonomous agents

* **Digital Identity**, including: 1) Technology and architecture for autonomy and control of self-sourced digital identity and personal data; and 2) Using individual identity for valid, verifiable login to apps or services and for providing legal acknowledgement, assent or authorization.

* **Digital Contracts**, including 1) Business, legal and technical interlinkage of blockchain "smart contracts" and legal contracts in automated individual or business transactions; and 2) Standard open-web stack design patterns for executing multiple digital signatures and electronic notarization on digital legal contracts.

* **Online Mock Trial & Design Charrette**: Applying basic legal rules to common business scenaries using new technology, class participants are challenged to argue for or against digital evidence of "enforceable intent to digitally sign" and  "valid informed consent" existed among parties in distributed blockchain transactions, automated web-based systems and self-driving vehicles or other autonomous devices. We explore business, legal and technical approaches to predict, prevent, avoid, reduce, shift or absorb the risks identified in the mock trial exercise.

* **Legal Hackathon Data Projects**: This course also provides optional opportunities to participate on project teams as part of "Legal Hackathon" style events, including 1) the Cyberlaw Committee of the American Bar Association Cyberlaw Committee "Legal Analytics Prototype Jam" and 2) the Financial Entity Identification and Information Integration (FEIII) "data challenge".

# Thurday, January 26

* **Preview Hangout: Legal Seminar Overview With Q&A**: We will conduct a live hangout on Thursday, January 26th from 4-4:30pm to preview and discuss the January 30 + 31 lecture/discussion courses on Digital Assets, Identity, Contracts and a preview of the planned online mock trial exercise.  
* Use this link to join the Q&A and participate in other live online engagement: [http://mit-course.computationallaw.org/Live](http://mit-course.computationallaw.org/Live) or to watch in broadcase mode, use this direct link to live hangout stream: [http://youtu.be/AW9hK1aRxlQ](http://youtu.be/AW9hK1aRxlQ)

* **Legal Hacking:** Optional pre-course "Legal Analytics" data challenge with the American Bar Association.  Join the collaborative team of Mass Data Analytics Legal Hackers and the Thomson Reuters Innovation Lab for this project to use data science for understanding and making decisions about software as a service contracts. This activity will include project working sessions during the day and a special late-night session for those intersted to participate online at the American Bar Association "Prototype Jam" legal analytics event happening physically in San Diego, California.
